description: Why I travel to the same places again and again
---


I have to been to Ladakh 3 times in the last 3 years. 

I feel travelling to the same place again and again makes you feel at home. You create different homes at different places.

Creating a physical structure doesn't make a place home. Home is where you are comfortable, familiar, peaceful. Where you have memories of growing up.

Most people associate idea of a home with ownership. You don't need to buy a house in Ladakh to call it home. You can overland there, you can rent a place which suits your needs.
The point 

Life is short and time is limited, why not explore different places?

Define different? What kind of different do you want? There could be different culture, different geography/landscape, different weather etc. 



When I say I go to the same places, it's the places
