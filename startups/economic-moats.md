While thinking of creating a defensible business, I found the mental model of creating economic moats very helful. It was termed by Warren Buffet and is the core principle of his investing style. To define, it is long term and sustainable competitive advantage that a business has, which could be leveraged to defend businesses from competetion and earn oversized profits.

Basic economic theory says that in a perfectly competitive market, rivals will eventually eat up any exess profits earned by a business. In other words, if a product/service has been commoditized and is easily replacable by substitutes, the profit margins will keep on eroding until it vanishes. Economic moats are strategies that businesses employ to defend there market share and profit margins from competeitors. Typically, there are 4 strategies which companies use to create moat :

- Network Effects
  Network effects are applicable when the value of a given product grows with each new user. Imagine an island of 100 people in which there are 10 groups of 10 people each, and each group speak different language. If a new person then learns English, well now all of a sudden 11 people know English, so when the next person comes to learn a new language, he is going to choose English. After a certain point, everybody will be speaking English and other languages will get competed out.

  Products which have network effects, benefit from first mover advantage and create a winner-takes-all dynamic. For example - payment networks like Visa and Mastercard. People carry these cards because these are accepted by merchants. On the other hand, merchants accept these cards because people carry them. It's a virtuous cycle. Facebook is another example, its value of increases as more people join it.

- High Switching Costs
  Switching is a expense or inconvinience that a customer incurs to move from one product/service to another. If not monetary expense, it can be the loss of time or and effort invested by the customer into that product. It might come in various forms like learning a complex software, logging your daily workouts or just browsing through pinterest for better future recommendations.

- Economies of Scale
  In general, digital products enjoy economics of scale due to there high fixed costs and low-to-zero marginal costs. For instance, AI based companies get better as they get access to more customer data and thus are able build better models.

- Intangible Assets
  These can come in different forms like intellectual property which can prevent other companies for duplicating there product. It can be the brand value associated with a product which resonates well with the users.
