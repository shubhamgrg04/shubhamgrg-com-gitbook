During the second world war, Germans used a warfare tactic called _Blitzkrieg_ or sometimes referred to as _lightning war_. The tactic was to surprise the enemy by concentrated attack on a narrow front and swiftly strike deep into enemy's territory. The main principle was to avoid fighting the enemy army head on. The reason German's used this tactic was because due to the Treaty of Versailles, German army was limited to 10 divisions. This constrained forced Germans to innovate.

Fast forward to 21st century, startups remind me of the German forces. They attack huge incumbments with enormous capital available, to disrupting large industries white creating tremendous wealth.

Understanding the _Blitzkrieg_ warfare tactic can provide some resemblance as to how startups succeed in disrupting industries.

So let's start with necessary ingredients to pull off a _blitzkrieg_. There are only 3 major ones:

- finding weak spot of an overconfident enemy
- moving swiftly
- fast decision making and communication among all commanders

The only way to defend a _blitzkrieg_ is to somehow reduce the speed of enemy and gain some time for counter attack. And that's what allied forces did to win.

In similar lines, the necessary ingredients of a succesful startups are:

- **insights on the weak spot of incumbments**: These insights could be about the demands of a niche audience, which have different needs from what the existing solutions provide. And while for the large incumbment, serving this niche might not make economic sense because the market doesn't appear to be large enough

- **rapid growth**: Rapid adoption is one the key requirements for startups success. There are several steps to it : -finding product-market fit -> finding the right distribution channels etc.

- **focus**: the whole team should be alligned in the goals of what is to be acheived. That's why startups are so keen about there KPIs.

The only major advantage a startup has compared to large incumbments is it's speed of execution. It is the ability to experiment and then learn faster, that enable startups to even exist. Thus, we can simpli

Today, we are used to listening about ambitious funding rounds by venture capital funds. The thesis behind these investments is the same, backing high growth companies, which can swiftly gain market share in massive markets. Such massive capital infusions enable startups to focus exclusively on growth while worrying less about the most efficient allocation of funds.

This high growth is only possible in two circumstances:

- there is fundamental shift - like an inflection point or a wave of sorts, which increased the demand of a product (like remote work)
- a new technological innovation which enables new possibilities (like blockchain)

There could be many reasons for a startup to fail, but these are the necessary conditions.

We can do some reverse engineering to find what kinds of startups ideas actually do succeed:

- shifts or techonological advancements
- huge market
- a team which can execute fast
